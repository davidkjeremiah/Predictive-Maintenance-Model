# Predictive Maintenance Model

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict equipment failures in an industrial setting. By leveraging sensor data, the goal is to create a robust predictive maintenance system that can proactively identify potential failures, enabling timely maintenance and reducing unplanned downtime.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

```

```

- **data/**: Contains the raw and preprocessed data files.
- **notebooks/**: Houses the Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration and model development.
- **src/**: Holds the Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and model evaluation.
- **models/**: Stores the trained machine learning model and evaluation graphs.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the required Python packages and their versions.
- **README.md**: Provides an overview of the project and instructions for setup and usage.

## Dependencies
This project requires the following Python packages:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- joblib

You can install the required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Explore the data and develop the machine learning model by running the Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.
6. Train the final model by executing the `model_training.py` script in the `src/` directory.
7. Evaluate the model's performance using the `model_evaluation.py` script.
8. The trained model is saved in the `models/` directory and can be used for deployment or further refinement.
